    "text": "Hello viewers,\nThis is for the Mini Project01 Fiscal Characteristics of Major US Public Transit Systems\nI am going to start by including the answers at the start of the document and then later on provide the code below.\n3.1. MTA New York City Transit – 10,832,855,350\n3.2. Bus – 49,444,494,088\n3.3 Number of trips – 180,458,819\n3.5. Drop by 211,969,660\n4.1. The most popular month for 2023 was October by Unlinked Passenger trips of 645,736,546.\n4.2. The most popular mode for 2023 was Bus by Unlinked Passenger trips of 3,296,556,237. \\\n4.3. The most travelled month for 2023 was August by Vehicle Revenue Miles of 422,002,435.\n4.4. The most travelled mode for 2023 was Bus by Vehicle Revenue Miles of 2,229,613,411\n6.1 MTA New York City Transit Heavy Rail with 1793073801 UPT\n6.2 Port Imperial Ferry Corporation, Ferry Boat with a Farebox Recovery of 1.43\n6.3 North Carolina State University, Bus with UPT/Expenses of 1.18\n6.4 Hampton Jitney Commuter Bus with a fares/UPT of 41.29\n6.5. Metropolitan Transportation Commission Vanpool with Expenses/VRM of 0.44\n6.6. Jacksonville Transportation Authority , Ferryboat of 157.70\nI decided to throw an additional fact for answer 4 as it was grouped together easier 2 x 2 solutions, And to answer the final question I would say that the Bus is the most efficient response as by my understanding it is about which mode of transport, is the best alternative to cars/driving and so the sheer volume of the bus is hard to ignore.\nNow for the real fun the coding component.\nPreliminary Work to bring in the data\nif(!require(“tidyverse”)) install.packages(“tidyverse”)\n\nLet’s start with Fare Revenue\nlibrary(tidyverse)
